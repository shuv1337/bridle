Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document covers the basics.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neiii/bridle.git
cd bridle

```

## Before You Contribute

- **Bug?** → Open an issue using the bug template
- **Feature idea?** → Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/neiii/bridle/discussions/categories/ideas) first
- **Question?** → Use [Q&A Discussions](https://github.com/neiii/bridle/discussions/categories/q-a)

## Development Workflow

### Building & Testing

```bash
# Check for errors (fast)
cargo check

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run a specific test
cargo test test_name

# Quality gates (run before committing)
cargo fmt -- --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

### Code Style

- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- All `clippy` warnings must be resolved
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Commit Messages

Keep them concise and descriptive:
- `fix: handle empty profile names`
- `feat: add amp harness support`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

## Pull Requests

2. Make your changes
3. Run the quality gates: `cargo fmt -- --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test`
4. Open a PR with a clear description of what and why
