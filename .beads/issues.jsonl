{"id":"bridle-eb8","title":"Add YAML comment preservation for Goose config","description":"# Task: YAML Comment Preservation for Goose Config\n\n## Context\n\nGoose uses `config.yaml` which users often annotate with comments. When we modify the `extensions` section to add MCPs, we MUST preserve these comments.\n\n## Problem\n\nStandard YAML libraries (like `serde_yaml`) typically discard comments during parsing. We need a solution that preserves them.\n\n## Research Required\n\nCheck available Rust YAML libraries for comment preservation:\n\n1. **yaml-rust2** - Fork of yaml-rust with more features\n2. **yaml-split** - May support preserving structure\n3. **serde_yaml** with custom deserializer - May be possible\n4. **String manipulation** - Parse only the part we need, preserve rest\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\nOption A: **Targeted insertion** (preferred if feasible)\n- Read file as string\n- Find `extensions:` section\n- Parse only that section\n- Insert new MCP entry\n- Write back with rest of file intact\n\nOption B: **Comment-preserving library**\n- Use a library that preserves comments\n- May require mapping between library's types and serde\n\nOption C: **yaml-rust2 with manual handling**\n- yaml-rust2 preserves more structure\n- May need manual comment tracking\n\n## Implementation Location\n\nIn `src/install/mcp_config.rs`, the `write_mcp_config()` function for Goose:\n\n```rust\nfn write_goose_mcp_config(\n    config_path: \u0026Path,\n    servers: \u0026HashMap\u003cString, serde_json::Value\u003e,\n) -\u003e Result\u003c(), McpConfigError\u003e {\n    // Read existing file content\n    let content = fs::read_to_string(config_path).unwrap_or_default();\n    \n    // TODO: Implement comment-preserving merge\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Test Cases Required\n\nCreate test file `tests/yaml_comment_preservation.rs`:\n\n```rust\n#[test]\nfn test_yaml_comments_preserved_after_mcp_insert() {\n    let original = r#\"\n# Main Goose configuration\nGOOSE_PROVIDER: anthropic  # Using Anthropic\nGOOSE_MODEL: claude-sonnet-4-20250514\n\n# Extensions section\nextensions:\n  # Built-in developer tools\n  developer:\n    enabled: true\n    type: builtin\n\"#;\n\n    // Insert MCP\n    let result = insert_mcp_to_yaml(original, \"test-mcp\", \u0026test_mcp_value());\n    \n    // Verify comments are preserved\n    assert!(result.contains(\"# Main Goose configuration\"));\n    assert!(result.contains(\"# Using Anthropic\"));\n    assert!(result.contains(\"# Built-in developer tools\"));\n    \n    // Verify MCP was added\n    assert!(result.contains(\"test-mcp:\"));\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test_yaml_existing_mcps_preserved() {\n    let original = r#\"\nextensions:\n  existing-mcp:\n    type: stdio\n    cmd: npx\n    args: [\"-y\", \"existing-package\"]\n\"#;\n\n    let result = insert_mcp_to_yaml(original, \"new-mcp\", \u0026new_mcp_value());\n    \n    // Both MCPs should exist\n    assert!(result.contains(\"existing-mcp:\"));\n    assert!(result.contains(\"new-mcp:\"));\n}\n\n#[test]\nfn test_yaml_creates_extensions_if_missing() {\n    let original = r#\"\nGOOSE_PROVIDER: anthropic\nGOOSE_MODEL: claude-sonnet-4-20250514\n\"#;\n\n    let result = insert_mcp_to_yaml(original, \"test-mcp\", \u0026test_mcp_value());\n    \n    assert!(result.contains(\"extensions:\"));\n    assert!(result.contains(\"test-mcp:\"));\n}\n```\n\n## Goose MCP Format Reference\n\n```yaml\nextensions:\n  mcp-server-name:\n    type: stdio          # or \"sse\", \"builtin\"\n    cmd: npx             # command (NOT \"command\")\n    args:                # arguments as list\n      - \"-y\"\n      - \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch\"\n    envs:                # environment vars (NOT \"env\")\n      API_KEY: \"${API_KEY}\"\n    enabled: true        # optional\n    timeout: 30          # in SECONDS (not ms)\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.

Edge Cases\n\n### Long Profile Names\n- Truncate with ellipsis in table/card title\n- Full name shown in detail pane\n\n```rust\nfn truncate_name(name: \u0026str, max_len: usize) -\u003e String {\n    if name.len() \u003c= max_len {\n        name.to_string()\n    } else {\n        format!(\"{}…\", \u0026name[..max_len-1])\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Long Model Names  \n- Already handled: split on '/' and take last segment\n- Further truncate to 18 chars in table\n\n### Many MCP Servers\n- Dashboard detail pane: Show all (scrollable if needed)\n- Card view: Truncate with \"+N more\"\n\n### Very Long MCP Server Names\n```rust\nfn truncate_server_name(name: \u0026str) -\u003e \u0026str {\n    if name.len() \u003e 20 {\n        \u0026name[..17].trim_end()  // Leave room for \"...\"\n    } else {\n        name\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Unicode in Names\n- Ensure proper width calculation using `unicode-width` crate (optional)\n- Or just treat all chars as width 1 (simpler, may misalign CJK)\n\n### Terminal Resize\n- Layout recalculates on each frame (already handled by ratatui)\n- Card view columns adjust automatically\n\n### No Harness Selected (edge case)\n- Should never happen (always select first harness on init)\n- Defensive: show \"Select a harness\" message\n\n## 4. Detail Modal for Card View\n\nWhen user presses Space in card view, show a modal with full details.\n\n```rust\n#[cfg(feature = \"tui-cards\")]\nfn render_detail_modal(frame: \u0026mut Frame, profile: \u0026ProfileInfo) {\n    let area = frame.area();\n    \n    // 80% width, 80% height, centered\n    let width = (area.width * 80 / 100).min(60);\n    let height = (area.height * 80 / 100).min(25);\n    let x = (area.width - width) / 2;\n    let y = (area.height - height) / 2;\n    let modal_area = Rect::new(x, y, width, height);\n    \n    frame.render_widget(Clear, modal_area);\n    \n    // Reuse DetailPane content rendering\n    let content = DetailPane::render_content(profile);\n    \n    let block = Block::default()\n        .title(format!(\" {} \", profile.name))\n        .title_alignment(Alignment::Center)\n        .borders(Borders::ALL)\n        .border_style(Style::default().fg(Color::Cyan))\n        .style(Style::default().bg(Color::Black));\n    \n    Paragraph::new(content).block(block).render(modal_area, frame.buffer_mut());\n}\n```\n\n## 5. Keyboard Handling Updates\n\n```rust\n// Space key behavior\nKeyCode::Char(' ') =\u003e {\n    match app.view_mode {\n        ViewMode::Dashboard =\u003e {\n            // Could toggle focus to detail pane for scrolling\n            // Or just ignore (details always visible)\n            app.status_message = Some(\"Details shown on right\".to_string());\n        }\n        #[cfg(feature = \"tui-cards\")]\n        ViewMode::Cards =\u003e {\n            app.show_detail_modal = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Help modal shows correct keybinds for current view\n- [ ] Help modal shows current view name at bottom\n- [ ] Empty state renders correctly (no profiles)\n- [ ] Empty state for uninstalled harness\n- [ ] Long names truncate with ellipsis\n- [ ] Many MCP servers handled gracefully\n- [ ] Card view detail modal works (Space key)\n- [ ] Terminal resize doesn't break layout\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\n# Test empty states\ncargo run -- profile delete claude-code default\ncargo run -- tui\n\n# Test with many MCPs (edit config manually)\n# Test terminal resize (drag window while TUI running)\n# Test help modal (press ?)\n\n# Card view tests (if feature enabled)\ncargo run --features tui-cards -- tui\n# Press Space on a card to see detail modal\n```\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T17:10:49.630819Z","updated_at":"2025-12-28T19:25:44.256268Z","closed_at":"2025-12-28T19:25:44.256268Z","close_reason":"Added view-mode-aware help modal, empty state rendering for ProfileTable, truncation already existed.

longer needed)\n\n## Widget 2: StatusBar\n\n### Visual Design\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ ←→:harness  j/k:nav  Enter:switch  Space:details  ?:help   │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nWith message:\n```\n│ ←→:harness  j/k:nav  ...  │  Switched to 'default'        │\n```\n\n### Implementation\n\n**File**: `src/tui/widgets/status_bar.rs`\n\n```rust\nuse ratatui::{\n    buffer::Buffer,\n    layout::Rect,\n    text::{Line, Span},\n    widgets::{Paragraph, Widget},\n};\nuse crate::tui::theme::Theme;\n\npub

struct in `src/tui/mod.rs`:\n\n```rust\n// Remove Pane enum (no longer needed for pane focus)\n// Keep for potential detail pane focus in dashboard\n\n// Update handle_key for horizontal harness navigation\nfn handle_normal_key(\u0026mut self, key: KeyCode) {\n    match key {\n        // Harness navigation (horizontal)\n        KeyCode::Left | KeyCode::Char('h') =\u003e self.prev_harness(),\n        KeyCode::Right | KeyCode::Char('l') =\u003e self.next_harness(),\n        \n        // Profile navigation (vertical)\n        KeyCode::Up | KeyCode::Char('k') =\u003e self.prev_profile(),\n        KeyCode::Down | KeyCode::Char('j') =\u003e self.next_profile(),\n        \n        // Actions\n        KeyCode::Enter =\u003e self.switch_to_selected(),\n        KeyCode::Char(' ') =\u003e self.toggle_details(),\n        // ... rest unchanged\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] HarnessTabs renders horizontally with status indicators\n- [ ] Left/Right arrows switch harness selection\n- [ ] StatusBar shows keybindings and optional message\n- [ ] Existing profile navigation still works\n- [ ] No Tab key confusion (removed pane switching)\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\ncargo run -- tui\n# - Verify tabs render at top\n# - Press ← → to switch harnesses\n# - Verify status bar shows at bottom\n# - Verify j/k still navigates profiles\n```\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T17:08:10.342032Z","updated_at":"2025-12-28T19:19:10.478549Z","closed_at":"2025-12-28T19:19:10.478549Z","close_reason":"Implemented

This epic adds MCP installation support, which is more complex because:\n1. Each harness uses different config formats (YAML vs JSON vs JSONC)\n2. Each harness stores MCP config in different locations and structures\n3. MCPs must be merged additively (not overwrite existing MCPs)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- harness-locate 0.3.0 (breaking changes from 0.2.x)\n- skills-locate 0.2.0 (breaking changes from 0.1.x)\n\n## Harness Config Details\n\n| Harness | Config File | JSON Path | Format |\n|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|\n| Claude Code | .mcp.json | /mcpServers | JSON |\n| OpenCode | opencode.jsonc | /mcp | JSONC |\n| Goose | config.yaml | /extensions | YAML |\n| AMP Code | settings.json | \"amp.mcpServers\" (literal key) | JSON |\n\n## Key API (harness-locate 0.3)\n\n```rust\n// Convert MCP server to harness-native format\nlet native_value = server.to_native_value(HarnessKind::ClaudeCode, \u0026name)?;\n\n// Check for unresolved env vars\nlet env_vars = server.env_var_names();\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. User can run `bridle install owner/repo` and select MCPs to install\n2. MCPs are installed to selected profiles (following same UX as skills)\n3. If profile is active, MCP is also written to live harness config\n4. Existing MCPs in config are preserved (additive merge)\n5. Conflicts (same MCP name) are detected and skipped with warning\n6. Unresolved env vars trigger a warning but don't block installation\n7. YAML comments are preserved when modifying Goose config\n8.

{"id":"bridle-ypz","title":"Goose config.yaml parsing fails entirely with YAML error","description":"Running 'profile show goose test' produces 'ERROR: expected value at line 1 column 1' - the YAML parsing fails completely before any extraction can happen. The Goose config.yaml uses ALL_CAPS keys (GOOSE_MODEL, GOOSE_PROVIDER, etc.) which are valid YAML but may be tripping up the parser. This blocks all Goose profile functionality. Separate from the GOOSE_MODEL key name issue (bridle-ju4).\n\n## Verification Steps\n\n1. Ensure test profile exists:\n   ```bash\n   cargo run -- profile list goose\n   # Should show 'test' profile\n   ```\n\n2. Run the failing command:\n   ```bash\n   cargo run -- profile show goose test\n   ```\n\n3. **Before fix**: Shows 'ERROR: expected value at line 1 column 1'\n\n4. **After fix**: Should display profile info without YAML parse errors. At minimum:\n   - Path should show correctly\n   - No parse errors in output\n   - Model may still be '(not set)' until bridle-ju4 is fixed\n\n5.

Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] ProfileTable shows name, model (truncated), MCP count columns\n- [ ] Selected profile highlighted with `\u003e` symbol\n- [ ] Active profile shows green `●` marker\n- [ ] DetailPane always shows selected profile's full info\n- [ ] Layout is responsive (40/60 split)\n- [ ] Empty state when no profiles exist\n- [ ] Keybinds work: j/k navigate, Enter switches, Space for future details mode\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\ncargo run -- tui\n# Verify:\n# - Three-pane layout renders correctly\n# - j/k moves selection in profile table\n# - Detail pane updates as selection changes\n# - Enter switches to selected profile\n# - MCP servers show with ✓/✗ markers\n# - Resource counts display correctly\n```\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T17:09:08.471557Z","updated_at":"2025-12-28T19:20:34.289137Z","closed_at":"2025-12-28T19:20:34.289137Z","close_reason":"Created
